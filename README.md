# SkAB Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark
This repository contains data for evaluating Anomaly Detection algorithms provided by IIot testbed system

## Experiments
Experiments folder contains Ipython notebooks with the code for the initial leaderboard results reproducing.
We proposed 5 anomaly detection algorithms:
- $T^2$ statistics
- $T^2+Q$ statistics based on PCA
- Isolation forest
- LSTM
- Feed-Forward Autoencoder

## Leaderboard (Scoreboard)
Here we propose an initial leaderboard for SkAB v1.0 both for outlier and changepoint detection problems.
