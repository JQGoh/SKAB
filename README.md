# SkAB Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark
This repository contains the data provided by IIot testbed system for evaluating Anomaly and Changepoint Detection algorithms.

## Experiments
Experiments folder contains Ipython notebooks with the code for the initial leaderboard results reproducing.
We have calculated the results for 5 common anomaly detection algorithms:
- Hotelling's T-squared statistics;
- Hotelling's T-squared statistics + Q statistics based on PCA;
- Isolation forest;
- LSTM-based RNN;
- Feed-Forward Autoencoder.

## Leaderboard (Scoreboard)
Here we propose an initial leaderboard for SkAB v1.0 both for outlier and changepoint detection problems.
